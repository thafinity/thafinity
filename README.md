I am intrigued by,
🌿 Environmental Issues – sustainability through a systems lens
🖥️ Computer Engineering – decoding how things work, bottom-up
🛠️ Building Projects – practical tools with real-world impact
📊 Business & Strategy – solving problems that scale
🎨 Design & Creative Work – where function meets imagination

Actively contributing in,
